pdfcat
======

Command-line tool for combining PDF files.

This is implemented by a single Java class plus the iText PDF library.
As I recall is mostly a ripoff of some code from the iText tutorial, plus some minor changes.

The code is from ~2005, so I don't make any promises, but it still works on my machine (WOMM).
